\title{Mean of Squares for Errors (MSE) under Models 2 & 3 without replication}
\usage{
mse2.nointer.fn(dfra)
}
\arguments{
\item{dfra}{This is a data frame containing 3 columns or more.  The first column contains subject numbers (there could be duplicates
if a subject was assigned multiple ratings) and each of the remaining columns is associated with a particular rater and contains its
numeric ratings.}
}
\description{
This function computes the MSE for both the random factorial (Model 2) and mixed factorial (Model 3) without
subject-rater Interaction. This MSE is used for calculating confidence intervals and p-values associated with the inter-rater
and intra-rater reliability coefficients.
