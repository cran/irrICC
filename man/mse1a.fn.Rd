\title{Mean of Squares for Errors (MSE) under ANOVA Model 1A.}
\usage{
mse1a.fn(dfra)
}
\arguments{
\item{dfra}{This is a data frame containing 3 columns or more.  The first column contains subject numbers (there could be duplicates
if a subject was assigned multiple ratings) and each of the remaining columns is associated with a particular rater and contains its
numeric ratings.}
}
\value{
This function returns a vector containing the following 3 values:
1. mse: the MSE. 2. M: The total number of ratings from all raters and subjects. 3. n: The number of subjects that participated in the experiment.
}
\description{
This MSE is associated with the one-factor ANOVA model where each subject could be rated by a different group of raters. This MSE is used
for calculating confidence intervals and p-values associated with the inter-rater reliability coefficient.
