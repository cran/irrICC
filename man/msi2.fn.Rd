}
\arguments{
\item{dfra}{This is a data frame containing 3 columns or more.  The first column contains subject numbers (there could be duplicates
if a subject was assigned multiple ratings) and each of the remaining columns is associated with a particular rater and contains its
numeric ratings.}

\description{
This function computes the MSI under both the random factorial (Model 2) and mixed factorial (Model 3) ANOVA model with
