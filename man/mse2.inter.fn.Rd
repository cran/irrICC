\title{Mean of Squares for Errors (MSE) under ANOVA Models 2 & 3 with interaction.}
\usage{
mse2.inter.fn(dfra)
}
\arguments{
\item{dfra}{This is a data frame containing 3 columns or more.  The first column contains subject numbers (there could be duplicates
if a subject was assigned multiple ratings) and each of the remaining columns is associated with a particular rater and contains its
numeric ratings.}
}
\description{
This function can be used to compute the MSE under the random (Model 2) and mixed (Model 3) efffects ANOVA model with interaction.
This MSE is needed for calculating confidence intervals and p-values associated with the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability
coefficients.
